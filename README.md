Our topic

11. implement a "multiplication" operation between two input graphs
  * implement your own graph data structure
    * add nodes
    * connect nodes
  * implement connections with linked-lists (use a library API for the lists)
  * Wolfram Mathworld: Graph Cartesian Product
    * https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphCartesianProduct.html
    * focus on the statement cited as from Harary, 1994, and this is easiest to create a new graph with the vertices described and edges between them
