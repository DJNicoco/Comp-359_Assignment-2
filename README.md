Our topic

11. implement a "multiplication" operation between two input graphs
  * implement your own graph data structure
    * add nodes
    * connect nodes
  * implement connections with linked-lists (use a library API for the lists)
  * Wolfram Mathworld: Graph Cartesian Product
    * https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphCartesianProduct.html
    * focus on the statement cited as from Harary, 1994, and this is easiest to create a new graph with the vertices described and edges between them

## Introduction into Graph Cartesian Product

## Analysis Framework

We each created our own graph data structure and each graph will use linked lists to represent edges between nodes. We will implement an muiltiplication operation between two input graph using the Graph Cartesian Product.  

## Results

Each of us decided to implement the Graph Cartesian Product in C++, Pythona and Java. For my part, I focused on writing the c++ code. In my implementation, I created two types of graphs: the grid graph and the prism graph. To create the grid graph,
